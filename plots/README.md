# Plots

## Heatmap for Grid searches
### Imputation
Make sure that `../results/gs_impute_results.csv` exists which is generated by grid search for imputation params run from `../src` folder.

Run `python3 heatmap_imputation.py`. This generates a heatmap `figs/Global_params.pdf`.

### Pipeline2
Make sure that `../results/cv.json` exists which is generated by grid search for pipeline2 from `../src` folder. 

Run `python3 heatmap_pipelin2.py`. This generates a heatmap `figs/Local_params.pdf`

## Validation vs Test plot for local parameters
The data for this plot is read from `../results/submission.json` which was obtained by combining results from `cv.json` and submissions made on kaggle. 

Run `python3 validation_vs_test.py`. This generates a line plot `figs/Local_params_valid_test.pdf`. 

# Plot for Blending models
The data for this plot is read from `../results/models.csv` which was obtained by combining results from `../baselines` and submissions made on kaggle

Run `python3 models.py`. This generates a bar plot `figs/Models.pdf`

# Plot for Pipelines
The data for this plot is read from `../results.pipelines.csv` which was obtained by combining results from `../src` and submissions made on kaggle

Run `python3 separate_pipelines.py`. This generates a bar plot `figs/Pipelines.pdf`
